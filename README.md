# FRACDASH

FRACDASH is a research repo for translating a minimal, explicit subset of DASHI-style dynamics into FRACTRAN and testing what survives that translation.

The current project stance is strict:

- treat DASHI to FRACTRAN as an executable modeling problem, not a metaphor
- preserve signed balanced-ternary behavior with an explicit encoding
- keep claims about basin structure, geometry, and degeneracy at the level the repo can actually support
- prefer CPU-first measurement and reproducible artifacts before any GPU work

The repo is now running two coordinated tracks:

- a **solver track**, where Python DASHI-style local dynamics are compared against named-equation reference implementations
- a **guarantee track**, where signed IR plus paired-prime FRACTRAN realization provides deterministic, auditable, proof-carrying execution claims

## Current Status

The repo already contains a checked-out FRACTRAN baseline in [`fractran/`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/fractran) plus a benchmark harness and recorded CPU matrix artifacts under [`benchmarks/results/`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results).

What exists now:

- a trusted local CPU reference implementation in [`fractran/`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/fractran)
- a deterministic benchmark CLI via `fractran-bench`
- a compiled exponent-vector execution path for comparison against the baseline
- benchmark summaries showing the current optimization focus is still CPU work, specifically compiled-path tuning
- an expanded GPU routing matrix that now includes `primegame_small`, `mult_smoke`, `paper_smoke`, and the new `hamming_smoke` headless program across the batch_size `16..64` / steps `4..16` band
- three closed local bridge slices:
  - [`formalism/Physics1StepDelta.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/Physics1StepDelta.agda)
  - [`formalism/Physics3StepDelta.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/Physics3StepDelta.agda)
  - [`formalism/Physics15StepDelta.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/Physics15StepDelta.agda)
- one thin master instantiation layer over those witnesses:
  - [`formalism/BridgeInstances.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/BridgeInstances.agda)
- a stable cross-slice bridge regime summary at [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-19-bridge-regime-summary.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-19-bridge-regime-summary.md)
- an executable witness/status surface for the closed bridge family via [`formalism/ExecutionWitnessSketch.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/ExecutionWitnessSketch.agda) and `execution_status` emission in invariant artifacts

Upstream note:

- `../dashi_agda` merged PR `#1` on `2026-03-27`, adding the auxiliary
  witness/perf surface (`Kernel/KAlgebra.agda`, `Monster/MUltrametric.agda`,
  `Moonshine.agda`, `MoonshineEarn.agda`, `JFixedPoint.agda`,
  `PerfHistory.agda`, and `perf_da51.py`) on top of the canonical closure
  spine.
- FRACDASH should continue to treat that upstream addition as witness material
  for bridging and provenance, not as a change to the local executable subset
  or bridge correctness obligations.

Current Dashi-facing compression note:

- the tiny zkperf waveform sample established the first projection/reconstruction
  win, and the `summary.json` pass established that semantic labels help
  calibrate motifs, but `../dashi_agda/da51_shards/summary.json` is already too
  compact to be the real storage target
- the next correct target was the aggregate DA51 CBOR shard set under
  [`../dashi_agda/da51_shards/`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/da51_shards),
  because that layer still carries repeated CBOR keys, repeated FRACTRAN
  program skeletons, and real module-family semantics
- that aggregate CBOR codec now exists in
  [`scripts/compact_dashi_da51_shards.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/compact_dashi_da51_shards.py)
  with exact shard-byte reconstruction
- first measured result on the full shard set:
  - raw shards: `15658` bytes across `41` files
  - compact surface aggregate: `9275` bytes (`~40.8%` smaller)
  - semantic aggregate: `9971` bytes (`~36.3%` smaller)
- current read:
  aggregate CBOR factorization is the first Dashi-linked storage win that beats
  the raw upstream artifact itself; the remaining open question is whether the
  next meaningful gain is below the current shard boundary rather than in
  another higher-level normalization layer
- that below-shard question is now answered for the current shipped corpus:
  [`scripts/compact_dashi_da51_inner.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/compact_dashi_da51_inner.py)
  uses the frozen inner contract in
  [`DA51_BELOW_SHARD_CONTRACT.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/DA51_BELOW_SHARD_CONTRACT.md)
  to derive `fractions`, `trace`, and `trace_sha256` instead of storing them
  redundantly
- first measured below-shard result:
  - raw shards: `15658` bytes
  - aggregate shard surface codec: `9275` bytes
  - inner-payload codec: `5387` bytes (`~65.6%` smaller than raw, `3888` bytes
    smaller than the aggregate shard codec)
- current read:
  for the current shipped DA51 corpus, the meaningful next gain is below the
  shard boundary; the remaining policy question is whether to upstream this as
  a corpus-specific codec or keep it as FRACDASH-side research until the
  generator side is reconciled

What does not exist yet:

- the executable 10-basin obstruction experiments
- the canonical Phase 2 AGDAS bridge path from `all_dashi_agdas.txt` into executable FRACTRAN physics
- a fully numeric generic Agda theorem built directly into `RegimeValidBridge`; the current numeric layer is master-level and slice-dispatched in `formalism/BridgeInstances.agda`
- a confirmed runtime win over a standard named-equation reference solver

## Research Goals

The near-term questions are:

1. Can a small DASHI voxel transition system be compiled into FRACTRAN with a clear decode map?
2. Which invariants survive translation: locality, parity, reversibility, chamber structure, ultrametric behavior?
3. Do fixed prime sets impose the same kind of reachability obstruction discussed in the 10-basin analysis?
4. Can the basin graph be formalized well enough to verify a deterministic monotone-chain bound over the full `3^4` signed space?
5. Is the reported total degeneracy `113` structural or just coincidence?

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `ghc`
- standard shell tooling for the benchmark scripts

### Build The FRACTRAN Binaries

```sh
cd fractran
./build.sh
```

This produces:

- `./fractran`
- `./fractran-bench`

### Run A Quick Benchmark

```sh
cd fractran
./fractran-bench --scenario primegame_small --engine compiled --mode logical-steps --checkpoint-policy exact
```

Available benchmark engines currently include:

- `naive-fast`
- `reg`
- `frac-opt`
- `cycle`
- `compiled`
- `lut`

Notes:

- `cycle` is treated as an `at-least` checkpoint engine because fast-forwarding can overshoot a target logical step.
- The active benchmark matrix currently compares `reg`, `frac-opt`, `cycle`, and `compiled`.
- The `lut` path remains available for manual experiments but is not part of the active canonical matrix.

### Run The Canonical CPU Matrix

```sh
./benchmarks/run_cpu_matrix.sh
python3 benchmarks/summarize_cpu_matrix.py benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix.jsonl
```

The benchmark artifacts currently tracked in-repo include:

- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix.jsonl`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix.jsonl)
- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix-summary.json`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix-summary.json)
- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-toy-dashi-phase2.json`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-toy-dashi-phase2.json)

### Timing Regression Check

Use the timing regression gate to ensure new CPU work does not materially regress wall-clock:

```sh
scripts/run_cpu_regression.sh \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix.jsonl \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix-regression-<timestamp>.jsonl \
  0.50
```

Or invoke the checker directly:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_timing_regression.py \
  --baseline benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix.jsonl \
  --current benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-cpu-matrix-regression-*.jsonl \
  --engine compiled \
  --engine frac-opt \
  --engine reg \
  --min-baseline-seconds 0.0001 \
  --tolerance 0.20
```

It compares median `cpu_seconds` across the tracked `(scenario, engine)` pairs and exits non-zero if slowdowns exceed tolerance.

### CPU / GPU Profiling Before Optimization

The next performance milestone is profiling, not blind tuning.

Current working read:

- the imported `frac-opt` path is still the main exact-step CPU comparison point
- the local `compiled` path is already ahead of `frac-opt` on the sampled
  `primegame_*` matrix
- the current GPU path already wins in parts of the measured medium/large batch
  region, but not uniformly enough to skip profiling breakdowns

So the immediate question is no longer "can we beat the old baseline somehow?"
but:

- is there any obvious large CPU win left over `frac-opt` and the current
  `compiled` path?
- how much of current GPU cost is true device execution versus host/setup
  overhead?
- where should the deterministic CPU/GPU routing boundary move, if at all?

The profiling pass should keep three contracts separate:

- exact-step CPU: `compiled` vs `frac-opt` vs `reg`
- checkpoint/fast-forward: `cycle` on its own axis
- batched throughput: resident GPU versus compiled CPU batch execution

### Physics Invariant Target Check

Use the physics target gate after AGDAS/physics template or invariant-analysis changes:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_physics_invariant_targets.py
```

For CI-style output:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_physics_invariant_targets.py --json
```

This checks the current V1 physics target suite over the latest locked `physics2..physics8` artifacts:

- exact source-charge conservation and source-parity preservation
- exact locality and forward-cone bounds
- exact cycle-distance nonincrease
- perturbation-stability thresholds
- geodesic-like and curvature-like geometry surrogates evaluated over cycle-reachable local neighborhoods
- defect-attraction thresholds
- the existing controlled-hybrid progression and `physics4` overconstraint signature

The canonical target table lives in `PHYSICS_INVARIANT_TARGETS.md`.

That table should now be read through the current regime taxonomy:

- `conservative_contracting` = strict contraction plus zero transmutation
- `transmuting_contracting` = strict contraction plus bounded transmutation

The locked `physics2..physics8` exact-law package remains the conservative
subregime lock. It is no longer the universal bridge invariant set for every
widened slice.

Each invariant artifact now also emits an `observable_surrogates` block with shell/interior occupancy, action-phase occupancy, re-entry flow, latch alignment, and source-defect coupling summaries for exploratory physics interpretation.
Widened-family invariant artifacts also emit `execution_status`, which is the current stable reporting contract for local execution-admissibility and regime/family usage. The next comparison layer should read `physics15`, `physics19`, `physics20`, `physics21`, and `physics22` through that surface instead of treating widened slices as an undifferentiated exploratory block.
That widened-family comparison artifact now exists at [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-widened-invariant-family-summary.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-widened-invariant-family-summary.md) and its JSON counterpart. Current read: the widened family stays mixed-transmuting throughout, but recurrent-core size, terminal-state reduction, and direct boundary-to-interior re-entry improve monotonically through `physics22`, while `distance_to_cycle` remains the best candidate and geometry-surrogate values stay strong.
The next 6-register comparison anchor is now explicit as well: [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-physics22-baseline-delta.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-physics22-baseline-delta.md) shows that the `physics21 -> physics22` gain is concentrated in the deterministic recurrent core (`+81` edges, `-54` terminal states, `+54` direct boundary-to-interior re-entries) while the fixed-walk cycle/terminal split and the current geometry-surrogate values stay flat. That is the right baseline shape for future 6-register refinements to beat.
The next immediate comparison task is therefore two-sided:
- design the next 6-register refinement against that `physics22` delta shape rather than against older widened-family branches
- compare `physics22` to the 8-register branches on a shared summary surface so the wider carrier can compete with the active baseline using comparable outputs

### Deterministic Walk Waveforms

Use the waveform renderer to turn a saved phase-2 deterministic walk into both a
standalone HTML view and a PNG artifact:

```sh
python3 scripts/render_trace_waveform.py \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-agdas-physics23-phase2.json
```

It reads the phase-2 `deterministic_walk.path`, reconstructs the full state rows,
marks the cycle boundary when present, and emits:

- `<input>.trace-waveform.html`
- `<input>.trace-waveform.png`

If a matching invariant artifact exists, the renderer auto-loads it to annotate
the waveform with the current best candidate and regime usage summary.

### Deterministic Walk Graph

Use the trace-graph renderer when you want the saved deterministic walk shown as
an explicit directed state graph rather than as a register heatmap:

```sh
python3 scripts/render_trace_graph.py \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-agdas-physics23-phase2.json
```

It emits:

- `<input>.trace-graph.html`
- `<input>.trace-graph.png`

Scope note:

- this renderer uses the saved deterministic walk only
- edge width reports repeated edge use inside that walk
- edge color reports transition family
- it does **not** claim to reconstruct the full basin graph unless the source
  artifact already contains that graph explicitly
- keep this entrypoint as a lightweight explicit walk-graph utility; the
  `branch-density` mode below is the more canonical basin/topology view for the
  current rank-4 discussion

To compare multiple FRACDASH runs on the same page and in one PNG:

```sh
python3 scripts/render_trace_waveform.py \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-agdas-physics23-phase2.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-agdas-carrier8-physics6-phase2.json
```

This emits a stacked comparison artifact using the same normalized trace
contract as the single-run renderer.

The same visualization surface now has a first zkperf-side adapter as well:

```sh
python3 scripts/render_zkperf_waveform.py /tmp/zkperf-da51-python
```

That adapter currently renders the extracted `sample_*.cbor` rows as a small
temporal perf-side trace and records the wider shard-family counts in the output
metadata, so the FRACDASH waveform surface can start accepting zkperf-derived
inputs before the full `perf -> DA51Trace -> SensibLaw` reducer is closed.

The same normalized zkperf waveform JSON now has a first schema-aware compact
codec:

```sh
python3 scripts/compact_zkperf_trace.py stats \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-25-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-waveform.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-compact.json \
  --roundtrip-output \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-roundtrip.json
```

This compact form stores only the raw sample fields needed to reconstruct the
normalized waveform contract (`step`, event id, timestamp, period, pid, tid,
cpu mode, cid`) plus the current heuristic semantic labels
(`dashi_class`, `dashi_family`) and drops the derived matrix and annotation
fields. The first checked-in DA51 sample now shrinks from `5875` bytes to
`2139` bytes while round-tripping exactly.

The important point is that this is not generic entropy coding. The current
codec is a projection/reconstruction witness:

- persistent payload: the compact raw sample rows
- dropped payload: derived matrix and expanded annotations
- reconstruction: deterministic rebuild of the normalized waveform contract

In other words, the current gain comes from removing duplicated derived
structure, not from a general-purpose byte-level coder. This is the first local
MDL-style witness in the repo: keep the generating fields, recompute the
projection when needed, and require exact round-trip before promotion.

The next compression layer, if pursued, should sit above this one as motif
compression over repeated row patterns rather than replacing the current codec.
The most obvious first motif candidate is repeated
`(event_idx, pid, tid, cpu_mode)` structure with timestamp/period parameters.

That second layer now exists in the same entrypoint:

```sh
python3 scripts/compact_zkperf_trace.py stats-motif \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-compact.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-motif.json \
  --roundtrip-output \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-motif-roundtrip.json
```

On the checked-in DA51 sample, the motif layer finds two motifs and reduces the
compact artifact from `1695` bytes to `1539` bytes (`~9.2%` smaller than the
base compact form) while round-tripping exactly back to the compact rows. That
is a useful but modest gain, so the next real question is not whether motif
compression is valid, but which richer traces or motif grammars justify it.

The next Dashi-facing experiment is to insert a semantic labeling pass before
motif extraction. The compact row schema grows to include:

- `dashi_class`
- `dashi_family`

The initial classifier is deliberately heuristic rather than theorem-backed. The
goal is to test whether semantic equivalence classes yield materially better
motif reuse than the current surface grammar. The measurement stack for that
experiment is:

- raw -> compact
- raw -> compact -> surface motif
- raw -> compact -> semantic motif

That comparison now exists in the same entrypoint:

```sh
python3 scripts/compact_zkperf_trace.py stats-compare \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-25-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-waveform.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-compact.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-motif.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-semantic-motif.json
```

On the checked-in DA51 sample:

- compact with semantic labels: `2139` bytes
- surface motif layer: `1687` bytes, `2` motifs
- semantic motif layer: `1658` bytes, `1` motif

So the semantic path does beat the surface motif grammar, but only slightly on
this tiny trace (`29` bytes better than the surface motif layer). That is
enough to justify the direction, but not enough to claim that semantics has
become the dominant compression source yet.

The next target for tightening that result is not another tiny sample. It is
the real upstream witness summary emitted by
`../dashi_agda/perf_da51.py`:

- `../dashi_agda/da51_shards/summary.json`

That file is a better Dashi-facing compression target because it is directly
generated from the merged Agda/perf witness lane and carries real module names
such as `ActionMonotonicity.agda`, `Contraction.agda`, `DA51Trace.agda`,
`FixedPoint.agda`, `JFixedPoint.agda`, `Moonshine.agda`, `MonsterSpec.agda`,
and `Ultrametric.agda`. The next codec increment should therefore normalize and
compress that summary artifact before expanding to broader perf families.

That Dashi-summary normalizer now exists in a separate entrypoint:

```sh
python3 scripts/compact_dashi_perfhistory.py stats-compare \
  ../dashi_agda/da51_shards/summary.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-dashi-perfhistory-normalized.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-dashi-perfhistory-compact.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-dashi-perfhistory-surface-motif.json \
  benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-dashi-perfhistory-semantic-motif.json
```

On the current upstream summary:

- raw summary: `9758` bytes
- normalized analysis form: `23722` bytes across `41` rows
- compact normalized form: `14245` bytes
- surface motif form: `16586` bytes, `14` motifs
- semantic motif form: `14156` bytes, `22` motifs

So the Dashi-linked result is mixed:

- good: semantic normalization is real and semantic motif beats surface motif by
  `2430` bytes
- bad: the raw upstream `summary.json` is already more compact than the
  normalized/compact forms, so this is not yet a storage win over the source
  artifact itself

That means the `summary.json` path is useful for semantic analysis and Dashi
label testing, but not yet the right compression target if the goal is raw
artifact shrinkage.

An additional graph-facing mode now exists on the same renderer entrypoint:

```sh
python3 scripts/render_trace_waveform.py \
  --mode branch-density \
  --rank4-dataset benchmarks/results/rank4-dataset-latest.json \
  --phase2-artifact benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-agdas-physics23-phase2.json
```

This mode is separate from the existing deterministic-walk heatmap. It renders a
spectrogram-style view of the canonical rank-4 quotient surface using:

- a structural panel ordered by sector/stability over the projected raw-state axis
- an optional walk-time panel over the same axis
- graph branch activity as the default signal instead of plain occupancy density

The branch-density x-axis is now explicitly versioned by projection:

- `--x-axis raw-state`: detailed projected raw-state columns for debugging and hotspot inspection
- `--x-axis basin`: canonical 10-basin columns with reachability/stability annotations
- `--x-axis bucket`: experimental Gödel/fraction-band buckets for the "jumping between fractions" view

Examples:

```sh
python3 scripts/render_trace_waveform.py \
  --mode branch-density \
  --x-axis basin \
  --rank4-dataset benchmarks/results/rank4-dataset-latest.json \
  --phase2-artifact benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-agdas-physics23-phase2.json

python3 scripts/render_trace_waveform.py \
  --mode branch-density \
  --x-axis bucket \
  --rank4-dataset benchmarks/results/rank4-dataset-latest.json \
  --phase2-artifact benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-agdas-physics23-phase2.json
```

Current scope note:

- it is aligned to the canonical 6-register rank-4 surface
- it uses the rank-4 quotient machinery (`q(N)`) to project raw states into the
  same 10-sector frame
- `basin` is the preferred explanatory projection for the 10-basin / chain-height-4 discussion
- `bucket` is exploratory and should be read as an encoded fraction-band view, not a canonical basin claim
- it is experimental visualization support for the basin/topology discussion,
  not a proof of the 10-basin or chain-height-4 claims
- this is the preferred visualization path for the current basin/topology
  discussion, while `render_trace_graph.py` remains available for simpler
  explicit walk-graph inspection

### Fractran Submodule State

The local `fractran/` checkout is now in an interim repaired state:

- `.gitmodules` declares `fractran` again
- the local benchmark work is preserved on branch `frackdash-bench`
- the preserved local benchmark commit is currently `6ccc7cc`

Remaining blocker:

- the canonical remote should be a maintained fork rather than only
  `https://github.com/pimlu/fractran.git`
- until that fork exists and the preserved branch is pushed there, the repo is
  still carrying an interim submodule URL and a locally advanced gitlink

That cross-carrier summary now exists at [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-cross-carrier-baseline-summary.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-23-cross-carrier-baseline-summary.md). Current read: `physics22` remains the clearer active 6-register baseline, `carrier8_physics1` remains mainly an observable branch, and `carrier8_physics2` should now be treated as the active parallel 8-register experiment track because it already exceeds the 6-register baseline on at least one geometry surrogate, even though it is not yet a direct replacement baseline.
The first concrete successor trials are now in-repo as well. `physics23` clears the minimum 6-register successor condition by improving deterministic recurrent edges from `476 -> 503` while keeping the fixed-walk split, best-candidate signal, and geometry surrogates flat, but it does not yet improve terminal mass or direct re-entry beyond `physics22`, so it should still be read as a successor candidate rather than the new default baseline. On the 8-register side, `carrier8_physics3` does not materially move the `carrier8_physics2` baseline, `carrier8_physics4` showed that simple early hook placement was still not enough, and `carrier8_physics5` first made sampled `boundary_to_interior` nonzero but at a curvature cost. `carrier8_physics6` is now promoted as the provisional 8-register baseline: it keeps `boundary_to_interior = 6`, restores curvature (`~0.97`), accepts a small geodesic dip, and brings best-candidate strict decrease back near baseline. [`CARRIER8_PHYSICS5_TARGET_NOTE.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/CARRIER8_PHYSICS5_TARGET_NOTE.md) remains the prior target; the next refinement should aim to recover the small geodesic/strict-decrease loss without giving back boundary recovery or curvature.

### AGDA Formalism Check

Use the upstream formalism intake check when `../dashi_agda` semantics or the local bridge assumptions change:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_dashi_agda_formalism.py

The checker now covers the canonical closure/audit spine plus Stage C, minimal-credible adapter, MDL/Fejér, seam certificates, observable package, and known-limits QFT bridge modules, and records their local counterparts or gaps. The current result is `authoritative_formalism_detected=True`.

The next physics split is now explicit. The narrow branch stays on the existing 6-register carrier and tries to produce the first direct `boundary -> interior` re-entry (`physics21`) without breaking the exact V1 laws. In parallel, FRACDASH is adding a separate physics-local 8-register carrier (`carrier8_physics1`) that preserves the current `R1..R6` semantics and adds `R7` boundary-return memory plus `R8` transport/debt memory so later experiments can measure return type and deferred transport load directly instead of overloading the 6-register grammar.

That split is now implemented. `physics22` is the active 6-register exploratory baseline: it lifts deterministic edges to `364`, lowers terminal states to `365`, and raises direct `boundary_to_interior` re-entry to `63` while keeping the exact V1 laws intact and keeping corrected `geodesic_like_flow.near_min_ratio` at `~0.92`. The 8-register branch now exists as `scripts/agdas_physics8_state.py` plus `scripts/agdas_physics8_experiments.py`, with artifacts at `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-agdas-carrier8-physics1-phase2.json` and `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-physics-invariants-carrier8_physics1.json`; its current job is to expose `boundary_return_profile` and `transport_debt_profile`, not to replace the active 6-register baseline.

### Bridge Correctness Framing

The main open math problem is now stated as bridge correctness, not just
interpretation.

FRACDASH needs to make explicit:

- the source DASHI / AGDA transition semantics,
- the signed exponent-vector IR used as the compiled semantics,
- the final FRACTRAN realization layer for that signed IR,
- the compile and decode maps,
- the refinement relation used for exact or weak simulation,
- the quotient assumptions behind the reduced carriers,
- the simulation or refinement obligation actually claimed,
- the Lyapunov / contraction / decoder-validity / robustness obligations.

See [`BRIDGE_CORRECTNESS.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/BRIDGE_CORRECTNESS.md).

The first concrete oracle/proof loop now exists for `physics1`:

- Python delta extractor: [`scripts/export_physics1_deltas.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/export_physics1_deltas.py)
- Agda signed-IR proof scaffold: [`formalism/Physics1StepDelta.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/Physics1StepDelta.agda)

In this workflow, Python exposes `source -> target -> delta` records, Agda
certifies the signed-IR step law, and FRACTRAN remains the later nonnegative
realization target rather than the immediate semantic surface.

The current stable bridge claim is narrower and stronger than the earlier conservative-only reading:

- `physics1` and `physics3` are `conservative_contracting`
- the currently formalized Batch C family (`physics15`, `physics19`, `physics20`, `physics21`, `physics22`) now shows a stable mixed regime rather than a one-off anomaly
- `physics15` is the first formal widened slice, and the same master-layer bridge contract now survives through `physics22` without introducing a new regime class or bound shape

So the current bridge target is:

> exact paired-prime macro realization with well-formedness preservation, strict contraction, and bounded transmutation, where conservative slices are the zero-transmutation special case

### Theorem Split

The theorem architecture for the current phase is intentionally frozen as:

- [`formalism/GenericMacroBridge.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/GenericMacroBridge.agda) = structural, class-indexed bridge contract
- [`formalism/BridgeInstances.agda`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/formalism/BridgeInstances.agda) = stronger numeric theorem layer for the closed slice family

That split is deliberate. The generic layer carries the reusable execution/realization shape and regime witness interface. The master layer carries the current residual/transmutation inequalities for the closed family without asserting that those exact numeric choices belong in every future bridge instance.

The short repo-facing statement of the current result lives in [`CURRENT_FORMAL_RESULT.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/CURRENT_FORMAL_RESULT.md).

The current guarantee story should be read as:

- FRACTRAN is presently the best **auditable execution target**
- Python is presently the best **equation-probe and benchmark layer**
- if solver-style wins appear, they should be measured first on the Python side and only then used to motivate deeper FRACTRAN execution work for that family

### Named-Equation Probe

The first solver-oriented harness now lives at:

- [`scripts/named_equation_probe.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/named_equation_probe.py)

It compares a transparent NumPy reference implementation against a DASHI-style
balanced-ternary local update path for:

- `wave` as the first stress-test probe
- `heat` as the planned fallback family if the current dissipative bridge makes the wave probe structurally mismatched

The intent is decision-quality, not hype:

- if the probe aligns numerically and economically, the solver track gets promoted
- if it only aligns qualitatively, it stays interpretation-facing
- if it mismatches structurally, the repo records that the stronger win is currently proof-carrying execution rather than speed

Current recorded outcome:

- `wave` probe: structural mismatch, fallback to `heat`
- `heat` second shot: qualitatively aligned after switching to a quantized explicit diffusion update, but still not competitive enough for a same-accuracy speed claim

See:

- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-20-equation-probe-summary.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-20-equation-probe-summary.md)

Current practical conclusion:

- keep `heat` as the least-bad named-equation baseline if the solver lane is revisited
- treat the near-term project win as **proof-carrying / auditable execution**, not solver speed

That conclusion now has a reproducible upstream semantic boundary:

- `../dashi_agda` contains a real wave/unitary formal surface
- FRACDASH does not yet realize that surface as a numerically good executable
  wave solver
- so `wave` remains a formal bridge target, while `heat` remains the least-bad
  practical runtime comparison family

See:

- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-20-dashi-agda-wave-surface.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-20-dashi-agda-wave-surface.md)
- [`scripts/check_dashi_agda_wave_surface.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/check_dashi_agda_wave_surface.py)

### MonsterLean Intake Check

If you have the local `monster/` clone, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_monsterlean_intake.py
```

This writes a machine-readable intake summary and flags `axiom`/`sorry` usage in the shortlisted `MonsterLean` files so FRACDASH does not treat incomplete Lean claims as established results.

To extract a constants-only 10-walk candidate from `BottPeriodicity.lean`:

```sh
python3 scripts/extract_monsterlean_10walk.py
```

This emits a diagnostic JSON with parsed group constants and monotone-chain summaries under multiple stability definitions.

To freeze/lock the canonical 10-walk model and verify an independent FRACDASH transition-data derivation:

```sh
python3 scripts/freeze_monster10walk_canonical.py --strict-lock
```

Default lock mode requires transition-witness support from `physics8` and `physics9`. Use `--template-set <name>` only for one-off single-template checks.

To generate file-by-file Lean claim quarantine status:

```sh
python3 scripts/quarantine_monsterlean_claims.py
```

## Working Principles

- Docs before code. Update intent and experiment notes before changing implementations.
- No theorem inflation. Root-system, lattice, and moonshine language stays conjectural unless the repo contains an actual derivation.
- Signed behavior must be encoded explicitly. Do not hand-wave balanced ternary into unsigned FRACTRAN.
- Reproducibility is mandatory. Experiments need an entrypoint, summary, and saved artifacts.
- GPU work is downstream. The current baseline assumption is that algorithmic CPU wins matter more than naive early parallelism.

## External Reuse Boundary

FRACDASH should reuse GPU infrastructure from [`../dashiCORE`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashiCORE) by reference, adapter, or documented linkage when that becomes necessary. It should not copy those helper modules into this repo without a specific justification.

The first candidate files to reuse later are:

- [`../dashiCORE/gpu_common_methods.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashiCORE/gpu_common_methods.py)
- [`../dashiCORE/gpu_vulkan_dispatcher.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashiCORE/gpu_vulkan_dispatcher.py)
- [`../dashiCORE/gpu_vulkan_backend.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashiCORE/gpu_vulkan_backend.py)
- [`../dashiCORE/spv/`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashiCORE/spv)

The concrete FRACDASH bridge for that boundary now lives in:

- [`gpu/dashicore_bridge.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/gpu/dashicore_bridge.py)
- [`scripts/check_dashicore_reuse.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/check_dashicore_reuse.py)

Run the reuse smoke test with:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_dashicore_reuse.py
```

Override the default `../dashiCORE` location by setting `FRACDASH_DASHICORE_ROOT` if needed.

The current exact-step FRACTRAN GPU contract is documented in:

- [`GPU_CONTRACT.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/GPU_CONTRACT.md)
- [`gpu/fractran_layout.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/gpu/fractran_layout.py)
- [`scripts/check_fractran_gpu_layout.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/check_fractran_gpu_layout.py)

Run the contract parity smoke with:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_fractran_gpu_layout.py
```

The first real Vulkan step smoke now lives in:

- [`gpu_shaders/fractran_step.comp`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/gpu_shaders/fractran_step.comp)
- [`gpu/vulkan_fractran_step.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/gpu/vulkan_fractran_step.py)
- [`scripts/check_fractran_vulkan_step.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/check_fractran_vulkan_step.py)

Run it on the host with Vulkan access:

```sh
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.x86_64.json python3 scripts/check_fractran_vulkan_step.py --batch-size 4 --multi-steps 3
```

That entrypoint now validates single-state, batched one-step, and batched multi-step resident dispatch.

The first routing benchmark artifact now lives in:

- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-benchmark-primegame-small.json`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-benchmark-primegame-small.json)
- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-routing-matrix.json`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-routing-matrix.json)
- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-routing-paper.json`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-routing-paper.json)
- [`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-routing-matrix-extended.json`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-routing-matrix-extended.json)

Current measured hint on this host:

- for `primegame_small`-like resident workloads at `32` exact steps, GPU already wins at batch sizes `32`, `128`, and `512`
- in the broader matrix, CPU remains the safe default for `batch_size <= 4`, GPU is already preferred for `batch_size >= 128`, and `primegame_small` reaches the GPU-preferred region at `batch_size = 32`, `steps >= 8`
- `paper_smoke` shows the same threshold behavior, with GPU preferred at `batch_size = 32`, `steps >= 8`

## Deterministic GPU Routing Rule

The new extended matrix (`benchmarks/results/2026-03-13-gpu-routing-matrix-extended.json`) now samples the `16..64` batch / `4..16` step band for `primegame_small`, `mult_smoke`, `paper_smoke`, and the new `hamming_smoke` program. The measured shape lets us commit to a deterministic CPU/GPU rule on this host:

- Route to CPU when `batch_size <= 4` or when `batch_size = 16` and `steps < 16`.
- Route to GPU when `batch_size >= 32` and `steps >= 8`, or when the run has at least `16` exact steps regardless of batch size.
- The measurement still notes scenario-specific wins at `batch_size = 16`, `steps = 8` (particularly `hamming_smoke`) and at `batch_size = 32`, `steps = 4` for non-`primegame_small` workloads, but the deterministic rule above keeps the routing policy stable until we intentionally tune further.

This deterministic routing rule now feeds the GPU handoff plan: once the rule stabilizes, FRACDASH will upstream reusable dispatch helpers while keeping FRACTRAN semantics local.

## GPU Upstream Plan

The deterministic routing rule also serves as the gatekeeper for elevating reusable GPU helpers into `../dashiCORE`. See [`GPU_UPSTREAM.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/GPU_UPSTREAM.md) for the checklist: it reiterates the rule, requires rerunning the extended matrix after any CPU change to keep `compiled` stable, and then stages the actual upstream work module by module.

## Phase 2: Toy DASHI transitions

A new experimental entrypoint, [`scripts/toy_dashi_transitions.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/toy_dashi_transitions.py), defines a minimal FRACTRAN program for a signed 4-register ternary state space (`3^4 = 81` encodings). Each register state is encoded by one of three dedicated primes, and the script prints the FRACTRAN fractions plus a reference encoding and decoder. This gives us a concrete starting point for the Phase 2 CORE experiments (toy transitions, decoder, basin traversal) before we bring GPU scheduling into the mix. The script also explores the basin graph from a selected start value, reports monotone-chain statistics, compares fixed-prime and explicit-prime stepping across all states, and can emit a deterministic JSON artifact for reproducible basin and walk data.

[`scripts/agdas_bridge.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/agdas_bridge.py) is now the first executable AGDAS bridge stage. The AGDA code in `../dashi_agda` should now be treated as the authoritative formal source for the canonical closure semantics, especially the closure/audit surfaces under `DASHI/Physics/Closure/`. FRACDASH still executes only a compressed subset of that formalism, maintained locally via `AGDAS_BRIDGE_MAPPING.md`, `AGDAS_FORMALISM_INTAKE.md`, and the carrier/template experiments. The parser for source-coupled transition markers still exists, but it remains optional rather than the main path.
The current primary bridge baseline is the template transition set exposed by `scripts/agdas_bridge.py --emit-templates --template-set wave1`, and the Phase 2 runner can exercise template sets with `scripts/run_agdas_template_phase2.sh`. The template runner defaults to disabling the chain bound (set `FRACDASH_TOY_CHAIN_BOUND_TEMPLATE=2` to re-enable it) and selects the template set via `FRACDASH_AGDAS_TEMPLATE_SET=wave1|wave2|all`.
The wave-2 `MonsterState` / `Monster.Step` probe now runs as `FRACDASH_AGDAS_TEMPLATE_SET=wave2`, but its artifact is mostly terminal under the current 4-register encoding, which is evidence that richer Monster-style dynamics likely need a larger encoded state model.
That larger carrier prototype now exists in `scripts/agdas_wave3_state.py`: it expands the bridge carrier from `3^4 = 81` to `3^6 = 729` states so mask summary, candidate/admissibility, and a 2-trit window can live on distinct registers before we attempt the next Monster-facing experiment pass.
The first wave-3 execution path now exists in `scripts/agdas_wave3_experiments.py` and writes `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-template-wave3-phase2.json`. It confirms the larger carrier is wired, but it also shows the next missing piece clearly: the current Monster-facing wave-3 templates still model only a single step because no rule reintroduces pending choice/admissibility state after a transition.
For a more physics-facing path, FRACDASH now also has a local formal sketch in `formalism/PhysicsBridgeRefreshSketch.agda` and a recurrent `physics1` template set covering severity join, contraction-style relaxation, and boundary reset. Its artifact is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics1-phase2.json`, and it already shows nontrivial recurrent behavior on the existing 4-register carrier, making it the higher-signal bridge direction for now.
Execution admissibility and family tagging: `formalism/ExecutionWitnessSketch.agda` plus per-slice status in `formalism/BridgeInstances.agda` expose the current executable witness surface (well-formedness preserved per slice; family tag = regime class). Reports from `scripts/physics_invariant_analysis.py` include this under `execution_status` for traceability against upstream `ExecutionAdmissibility*` witnesses.
The widened `physics2` layer is implemented on a dedicated 6-register carrier with separate source severities, effective joined severity, region flag, signature latch, and action/energy phase. The carrier lives in `scripts/agdas_physics2_state.py`, the runner in `scripts/agdas_physics_experiments.py`, and the canonical artifact in `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics2-phase2.json`. On the first pass it produces a substantially denser recurrent structure than `physics1`, with `657` edges over `729` states, longest chain `12`, and a canonical 4-step scan -> join -> contract -> rearm cycle.
The `physics3` refinement is also implemented on the same 6-register carrier. It adds an explicit latent cone shell between boundary and interior and reports action-phase monotonicity directly in the artifact. The canonical result is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics3-phase2.json`, which increases the graph to `900` edges over `729` states, raises longest chain to `15`, and makes the canonical loop explicitly 5-step by splitting `boundary -> shell -> interior rearm`. Its first monotonicity split is mixed rather than cleanly ordered: `234` decreases, `504` preserves, `162` increases.
That next pass is now implemented as `physics4` on the same 6-register carrier. Its artifact is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics4-phase2.json`. The result is informative but not yet the new lead: stricter shell/interior guards cut action-rank increases from `162` to `9`, but they also collapse the recurrent structure to `162` edges, longest chain `9`, and `0` cycles, so every fixed walk terminates. In other words, `physics4` improves order cleanliness by overconstraining the bridge.
The `physics5` hybrid is now implemented as the next recovery pass. It keeps the `physics4` scan guard and discharged-boundary shell entry, but splits shell-to-interior rearm into a cleared rearm plus latched left/right rearms. Its artifact is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics5-phase2.json`. The result lands in the intended middle band: recurrence returns (`100` cyclic starts), action-rank increases stay far below `physics3` (`27` vs `162`), and the canonical deterministic walk becomes cyclic again. But it is still much sparser than `physics3` overall (`180` edges, longest chain `10`), so `physics3` remains the best current lead while `physics5` becomes the best ordered hybrid so far.
The `physics6` refinement is now implemented on top of `physics5`. It adds a narrow shell-refresh branch for latched shell states before cleared rearm. Its artifact is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics6-phase2.json`. This moves the ordered-hybrid line forward again: the graph grows to `198` edges, longest chain rises to `12`, cyclic starts rise to `115`, and action-rank increases stay flat at `27`. The canonical deterministic walk becomes a 6-step cycle with an explicit shell-refresh step. `physics3` still leads on overall richness, but `physics6` is now the best controlled hybrid. The earlier apparent timeout tail is now resolved inside the artifact: the one state that timed out at `--max-steps 12` becomes a cycle under the built-in diagnostic cap of `32`, so there is currently no evidence of a broader runaway tail.
The `physics7` refinement is now implemented on top of `physics6`. It adds a very narrow shell-local latch-probe path from cleared shell states. Its artifact is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics7-phase2.json`. This gives another controlled gain: the graph rises to `204` edges, cyclic starts rise to `116`, and action-rank increases stay flat at `27`. Longest chain remains `12`, so the gain is mostly breadth via preserve edges, not deeper chains. `physics3` still leads on total richness, but `physics7` is now the best controlled hybrid and does not show the earlier timeout ambiguity at `--max-steps 12`.
The `physics8` refinement is now implemented on top of `physics7`. It inserts a staged shell-release micro-step (`probe -> stage -> release -> refresh -> rearm`) while preserving the same action-rank jump surface. Its artifact is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-14-agdas-physics8-phase2.json`. This is the first constrained pass that improves both breadth and depth from the hybrid baseline: `222` edges, longest chain `13`, `132` cyclic starts, `0` timeouts at `max-steps 12`, and still `27` action-rank increases. `physics3` still leads on total richness, but `physics8` is now the strongest constrained hybrid path.
The `physics9` refinement is now implemented on top of `physics8`. It adds shell-stage mid probes while preserving the same release/rearm chain. Its artifact is `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-agdas-physics9-phase2.json`. This keeps the current constraints (`action-rank increases = 27`, `timeouts = 0`) and improves breadth to `228` edges, while keeping longest chain `13` and cyclic starts `132`.

[`scripts/toy_dashi_transitions.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/toy_dashi_transitions.py) is now wired to consume AGDAS candidates either from optional parsed source markers via `--agdas-path` or from the primary FRACDASH-side bridge templates via `--agdas-templates --agdas-template-set wave1|wave2|all`. This keeps the verifier and basin tooling usable without editing upstream AGDA sources.

The canonical artifact generation is now pinned to a monotone-chain bound of `2` for the full `3^4` fixed-prime walk space.
That pinning is a regression gate for this artifact stream: the command exits non-zero if any fixed-prime trajectory in the captured space exceeds the bound. It is not a claim of a global theorem unless we later pass additional evidence.

```sh
scripts/run_toy_dashi_phase2.sh
```

That script writes `benchmarks/results/YYYY-MM-DD-toy-dashi-phase2.json` and enforces the fixed-prime chain check by default (`2`), unless `--disable-chain-bound` is supplied (or `FRACDASH_TOY_CHAIN_BOUND=disable` is set).

You can keep the check interactive by adding `--disable-chain-bound` or using custom values with `--max-chain-bound`.

## Rank-4 Reproduction Artifacts

FRACDASH now has a local, reproducible rank-4 analysis pipeline that derives a canonical basin dataset from existing artifacts and runs both diagnostics and discriminator tests as scripts.

Entry points:

- [`scripts/derive_rank4_dataset.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/derive_rank4_dataset.py)
- [`scripts/run_rank4_diagnostics.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/run_rank4_diagnostics.py)
- [`scripts/run_rank4_discriminators.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/run_rank4_discriminators.py)
- [`scripts/run_rank4_canonical_gpu_parity.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/run_rank4_canonical_gpu_parity.py)

Run:

```sh
python3 scripts/derive_rank4_dataset.py
python3 scripts/run_rank4_diagnostics.py
python3 scripts/run_rank4_discriminators.py
python3 scripts/run_rank4_canonical_gpu_parity.py
python3 scripts/ablate_prime_triplets.py --template-set physics8
```

Strict-mode checks:

```sh
python3 scripts/run_rank4_diagnostics.py --strict-stable
python3 scripts/run_rank4_diagnostics.py --strict-lock
```

Current artifacts:

- `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-rank4-dataset.json`
- `benchmarks/results/rank4-dataset-latest.json`
- `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-rank4-diagnostics.json`
- `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-rank4-discriminators.json`
- `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-rank4-discriminators.md`
- `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-rank4-canonical-gpu-parity.json`
- `benchmarks/results/2026-03-15-prime-triplet-ablation.json`

Claim boundary remains strict:

- rank-4 identity-level claims are unproven
- diagnostics/discriminators are reported as experimental outputs, not proofs

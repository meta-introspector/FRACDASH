# TODO

## Current Bridge Checkpoint

- [x] close `physics1` as the first exact local `X -> Z -> Y` bridge slice
- [x] close `physics3` as the second exact local `X -> Z -> Y` bridge slice
- [x] promote the macro FRACTRAN layer from slice-local to bridge-generic on both the Python and Agda sides
- [x] strengthen structural `WellFormedY` into a substantive paired-prime exclusivity invariant on the closed slices
- [x] add bridge-core validators plus terminal-basin and contraction-cost summaries for the closed slices
- [x] widen the Python-side bridge pipeline to `physics15`
- [x] classify the `physics15_boundary_crossfeed_neutral` conservation break as intended widened semantics (`transmuting_contracting`), not a bridge regression
- [x] widen the next bridge slice batch (`physics19`, `physics20`, `physics21`, `physics22`)
- [x] freeze the theorem split for this phase:
  - `formalism/GenericMacroBridge.agda` stays structural / class-indexed
  - `formalism/BridgeInstances.agda` stays the stronger numeric theorem layer for the closed family
- [x] write the short current formal result note for the closed bridge family
- [x] re-anchor the physics-facing interpretation layer so conservation is scoped to the `conservative_contracting` subregime and widened Batch C slices are described through bounded transmutation

## Current Performance Checkpoint

- [x] add a CPU profiling runner that combines exact-step timing with GHC `.prof` / RTS breakdowns for `compiled`, `frac-opt`, and `reg`
- [x] add a GPU profiling runner that separates cold-start, warm-resident, and per-phase timing on the Vulkan path
- [x] capture one profiling artifact set and a short "obvious gain / no obvious gain" decision summary before any further CPU or GPU optimization work
- [x] keep `cycle` outside the exact-step winner comparison and profile it only as an `at-least` checkpoint engine

## Phase 1: Minimal Model

- [x] Define the smallest DASHI state space that still preserves balanced ternary structure.
- [x] Specify one signed-register FRACTRAN encoding and its invariants.
- [x] Evaluate CPU-first FRACTRAN baselines, especially cycle-detecting or fast-forwarding interpreters.
- [x] Inspect `fractran/src/Fractran.hs` and identify the seam where a benchmark harness or alternative state representation can be introduced with minimal disruption.
- [x] Extend the new `fractran-bench` harness with representative workloads, result capture, and stable output files.
- [x] Compare the new compiled exponent-vector path against `reg`, `frac-opt`, and `cycle` on the same workloads.
- [x] Define the LUT/divisibility-mask representation to test next.
- [x] Implement a CPU LUT path and benchmark it against the current matrix baseline.
- [x] Keep `cycle` on `at-least` checkpoint semantics in future matrices; do not regress to exact-step comparison.
- [x] Decide whether to pursue a threshold-aware generalized LUT or return to compiled-path tuning.
- [x] Port `frac-opt`-style rule-order narrowing into the compiled evaluator.
- [x] Reduce benchmark-side compiled-path decoding overhead and rerun the matrix.
- [x] Reduce compiled-path allocation overhead inside `Compiled.hs` and rerun the matrix.
- [x] Decide whether `compiled` is now the practical CPU baseline for subsequent work.
- [x] Decide the initial deliverable:
  - a direct interpreter for the signed encoding
  - a compiler from DASHI transitions to vanilla FRACTRAN fractions
  - a benchmark harness around an existing fast CPU interpreter
    The current deliverable is the deterministic benchmark harness (with compiled parity checks) that exercises the signed encoding.

## Phase 2: Core Experiments

- [x] Implement a toy DASHI-to-FRACTRAN transition set for a signed 4-register `3^4` state space.

  [`scripts/toy_dashi_transitions.py`](/home/c/Documents/code/FRACDASH/scripts/toy_dashi_transitions.py). Current artifact reports `max_observed_chain=2`, so the bound holds for `2`.
- [ ] Implement the full AGDAS physics bridge from the AGDA semantics in `../dashi_agda`:
  - [x] add typed extraction/parsing into transition primitives (`scripts/agdas_bridge.py`)
  - [x] map parsed transition rules into FRACTRAN candidates with provenance

  - [x] define a FRACDASH-side wave-1 mapping in `AGDAS_BRIDGE_MAPPING.md`
  - [x] implement FRACDASH-side wave-1 template transitions in `scripts/agdas_bridge.py`)
  - [x] run the wave-1 template transitions through the Phase 2 verifier path (`--agdas-templates`)
  - [x] add a compressed wave-2 `MonsterState` / `Monster.Step` template set
  - [x] run the wave-2 template set through the Phase 2 verifier path and capture the artifact
  - [x] decide to enlarge the encoded state model before widening beyond the compressed Monster seam
  - [x] note the upstream PR `#1` witness/perf surface as merged and treat it as auxiliary bridge material only
  - [x] add a prototype wave-3 enlarged state carrier in `scripts/agdas_wave3_state.py`

  - [x] design a `physics12` refinement that increases chain depth beyond `13` while preserving `increases=27` and `timeouts=0`

  - [x] design and implement a `physics20` refinement that widens the deterministic recurrent graph beyond `274` edges while preserving the exact V1 laws and measuring the result against the corrected cycle-reachable geometry surrogate
  - [x] design and implement a `physics21` refinement on the same 6-register carrier that produces the first direct `boundary -> interior` re-entry while preserving the exact V1 laws and keeping corrected geodesic-like flow at or above `0.90`
  - [x] add a physics-local 8-register carrier branch with explicit boundary-return memory and transport/debt memory, then capture the first `carrier8_physics1` artifact with branch-local observable summaries
  - [x] add an authoritative AGDA closure intake/check artifact against `../dashi_agda`:
    - [x] verify the canonical closure/audit modules exist and are readable
    - [x] record their local FRACDASH executable counterparts or current gaps
    - [x] treat that artifact as the source-of-truth bridge status for future physics work
  - [x] document upstream Stage C / minimal-credible / seam / observable surfaces and their FRACDASH wiring map in `AGDAS_FORMALISM_INTAKE.md`
  - [x] extend the formalism checker to cover Stage C, MDL/Fejér/seam, observable, and known-limits QFT bridge modules
  - [x] refresh the formalism intake for the upstream execution-admissibility / family-classification witness expansion in `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure`, `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness`, and `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`
  - [x] add a first explicit FRACDASH-side executable witness/status layer (ExecutionWitnessSketch + per-slice status in BridgeInstances) for upstream execution admissibility beyond the regime-surrogate bridge theorems; reporters now emit `execution_status`
  - [x] add per-slice regime-class usage summary to execution status (conservative-only vs mixed transmuting)

  - [x] bulk-wire upstream surfaces into FRACDASH execution and reporting:

    - [x] surface MDL/Fejér and seam certificate checks (or TODO stubs) in the physics target suite
    - [x] emit lift/scan/Monster provenance on generated templates for debugging and regression
- [ ] Introduce a prime-exponent-vector engine for batched runs and compare it against the bigint/cycle-detecting baseline.
- [ ] Prototype LUT or divisibility-mask rule selection on CPU before any GPU port.

## Phase 3: Interpretation

- [ ] Measure which invariants survive translation: locality, parity, reversibility, contraction, chamber structure.
- [x] Define a canonical physics-invariant target table (numbers + relationships) for `physics2..physics8`.
- [x] Add a physics-invariant regression checker that validates new artifacts against the canonical target table.
- [x] Upgrade the physics target table to a V1 mixed exact/statistical suite with direct physics-facing surrogate laws.
- [x] Extend invariant artifacts to emit `source_charge`, parity, locality, forward-cone, perturbation-stability, geodesic-like, curvature-like, and defect-attraction measurements.
- [x] Add a first observable-surrogate block beyond the V1 law table so artifacts also report shell/interior occupancy, source-defect alignment, and re-entry flow statistics.
- [x] Extend observable surrogates with branch-aware re-entry and 8-register memory profiles:
  - [x] `boundary_return_profile` for return-memory-tagged 8-register states
  - [x] `transport_debt_profile` for transport/debt occupancy splits on the 8-register branch
- [x] Promote `physics22` as the active exploratory 6-register baseline for future invariant work.
- [x] Build a widened-family comparison artifact for `physics15`, `physics19`, `physics20`, `physics21`, and `physics22` that aligns `execution_status` / regime usage with recurrent-core and geometry-surrogate outcomes.
- [x] Build a `physics21 -> physics22` baseline-delta artifact so future 6-register refinements are judged against the actual handoff gain shape, not just the widened-family endpoint table.
- [ ] Design the next 6-register refinement against the `physics22` baseline-delta target:
  - preserve the current fixed-walk cycle/terminal split
  - preserve `distance_to_cycle` as best candidate and keep geometry surrogates at least flat
  - improve the deterministic recurrent core beyond the current `physics22` delta profile
- [x] Decide whether the first `physics23` trial (`476 -> 503` deterministic edges, other main axes flat) is enough to replace `physics22` as the active 6-register baseline or should remain a successor candidate only.
- [x] Keep `physics23` as a genuine successor candidate, but not the active baseline yet: it improves the deterministic recurrent core without yet beating `physics22` on terminal mass or direct re-entry.
- [x] Build a cross-carrier comparison artifact that lines up the active 6-register baseline (`physics22`) against the exploratory 8-register branches on comparable recurrent-core / geometry / branch-local-observable axes.
- [x] Decide whether to treat `carrier8_physics2` as the active parallel 8-register experiment track, distinct from but not replacing the `physics22` 6-register baseline.
- [x] Treat `carrier8_physics2` as the active parallel 8-register track for now; `carrier8_physics3` did not move the shared comparison surface enough to dislodge it.
- [x] Design the next 8-register refinement beyond `carrier8_physics2/3`; target the actual weak point from `carrier8_physics3` by inserting an earlier boundary-return re-entry hook that can compete with the broad return-memory damping rules.
- [x] Design the next 8-register refinement beyond `carrier8_physics4`; the first early re-entry insertion still leaves the shared cross-carrier summary flat, so the next branch should target a deeper carrier8 basin/selection change rather than another placement-only tweak.
- [x] Decide whether `carrier8_physics5` is enough to replace `carrier8_physics2` as the active parallel 8-register baseline or should remain a successor candidate only; it is the first branch with nonzero sampled `boundary_to_interior`, but it gives back some curvature spread.
- [x] Promote `carrier8_physics6` as the provisional 8-register baseline: keeps `boundary_to_interior=6`, restores curvature (`~0.97`), small geodesic dip (`~0.989`), best-candidate strict decrease back to baseline (`~0.515`).
- [ ] Ingest a real source/attractor basis (ERDFA/CFT eigenvectors or PCA) and rerun physics6 with `--cone-basis` to get selective Δ-cone rejection; current placeholder bases reject 0 edges.
- [ ] Design the next 8-register refinement beyond `carrier8_physics6` informed by the rejection pattern from a source-aligned cone; target geodesic/strict recovery without losing boundary/curvature.
- [x] Add a deterministic-walk waveform renderer for saved phase-2 artifacts:
  - `scripts/render_trace_waveform.py`
  - emits standalone HTML + PNG from `deterministic_walk.path`
  - auto-enriches from matching invariant artifacts when available
- [x] Extend the waveform renderer to compare multiple saved phase-2 artifacts on
  one normalized stacked surface (single HTML + PNG comparison output).
- [x] Extend the same renderer with a graph-facing `branch-density` mode for the
  canonical rank-4 dataset, keeping the current waveform HTML/PNG behavior
  unchanged unless the new mode is explicitly requested.
- [x] Add explicit `branch-density` x-axis projections so the renderer can show
  the same rank-4 surface as projected raw states, canonical basins, or
  experimental Gödel/fraction buckets without changing the existing waveform
  defaults.
- [x] Keep both visualization entrypoints:
  - `scripts/render_trace_waveform.py --mode branch-density` stays the
    canonical rank-4 basin/topology surface
  - `scripts/render_trace_graph.py` stays the simpler explicit
    deterministic-walk graph utility
- [x] Enrich saved `deterministic_walk` payloads with explicit per-step trace
  fields (`delta`, changed-register mask/list, L1 step delta, action-rank
  before/after, and precomputed state rows/register labels) so downstream
  renderers do not need to recompute the entire walk schema.
- [x] Add the first zkperf waveform adapter on top of extracted DA51 sample
  shards:
  - `scripts/render_zkperf_waveform.py`
  - decodes `sample_*.cbor` rows from `zkperf-schema extract`
  - emits normalized JSON plus HTML + PNG waveform artifacts
- [x] Add a first compact zkperf trace codec on top of the normalized waveform
  JSON:
  - target the existing small `*.trace-waveform.json` artifact first
  - store only the raw sample fields needed to reconstruct the normalized
    waveform contract
  - require round-trip reconstruction of `matrix`, `metadata`, and
    `step_annotations` before treating the codec as useful
  - implemented in `scripts/compact_zkperf_trace.py`
  - regression-covered by `scripts/test_compact_zkperf_trace.py`
  - first measured artifact:
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-compact{,.stats}.json`
    with exact round-trip reconstruction through
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-roundtrip.json`
- [x] Add a second-layer motif codec on top of the current compact zkperf
  rows:
  - treat the current compact form as the canonical persistent base layer
  - search for repeated row motifs before introducing any new byte-level coder
  - start with repeated `(event_idx, pid, tid, cpu_mode)` structure plus
    timestamp/period parameters
  - require exact round-trip back to the current compact rows before treating
    motif compression as valid
  - record the gain separately from the current projection/reconstruction gain
  - implemented in `scripts/compact_zkperf_trace.py` via `encode-motif`,
    `decode-motif`, and `stats-motif`
  - regression-covered by `scripts/test_compact_zkperf_trace.py`
  - first measured artifact:
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-motif{,.stats}.json`
    with exact round-trip reconstruction through
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-motif-roundtrip.json`
  - current measured gain on the tiny DA51 sample is modest:
    `1695 -> 1539` bytes (`~9.2%` smaller than the compact base layer)
- [ ] Test the current projection + motif stack on richer trace families before
  designing a third compression layer:
  - run the same codec over larger or more varied zkperf/perf-derived traces
  - measure whether motif count and additional gain scale with real repetition
  - if gains stay small, redesign the motif grammar before adding more layers
- [x] Add a Dashi-facing semantic labeling pass before motif extraction:
  - extend the compact row schema with `dashi_class` and `dashi_family`
  - start with a stub classifier only; do not overclaim theorem-backed Dashi
    semantics yet
  - compare:
    - raw -> compact
    - raw -> compact -> surface motif
    - raw -> compact -> semantic motif
  - require exact round-trip back to the semantic compact rows before treating
    the semantic motif layer as valid
  - use the result to decide whether the current weak motif gain is a trace-size
    problem or a surface-grammar problem
  - implemented in `scripts/compact_zkperf_trace.py`
  - regression-covered by `scripts/test_compact_zkperf_trace.py`
  - first measured comparison artifact:
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-zkperf-zkperf-da51-python.trace-compare.stats.json`
  - current result on the tiny DA51 sample:
    - compact with semantic labels: `2139` bytes
    - surface motif: `1687` bytes with `2` motifs
    - semantic motif: `1658` bytes with `1` motif
    - semantic motif beats surface motif, but only slightly (`29` bytes)
- [ ] Tighten the heuristic semantic labels against the actual `dashi_agda`
  witness lane before making strong Dashi-native claims:
  - source or check the current `dashi_class` / `dashi_family` labels against
    `PerfHistory.agda` / `perf_da51.py`
  - keep the current classifier explicitly heuristic until that cross-check
    exists
- [x] Normalize and compare the real upstream `dashi_agda` witness summary:
  - target `../dashi_agda/da51_shards/summary.json`
  - derive `dashi_class` / `dashi_family` from actual Agda module names rather
    than only from the tiny zkperf sample transition labels
  - compare the same three stages:
    - raw -> compact
    - raw -> compact -> surface motif
    - raw -> compact -> semantic motif
  - use this result to decide whether semantic compression scales on a genuinely
    Dashi-linked dataset before widening to broader perf families
  - implemented in `scripts/compact_dashi_perfhistory.py`
  - regression-covered by `scripts/test_compact_dashi_perfhistory.py`
  - first measured comparison artifact:
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-dashi-perfhistory-compare.stats.json`
  - current result on `../dashi_agda/da51_shards/summary.json`:
    - raw summary: `9758` bytes
    - normalized analysis form: `23722` bytes over `41` rows
    - compact normalized form: `14245` bytes
    - surface motif: `16586` bytes with `14` motifs
    - semantic motif: `14156` bytes with `22` motifs
  - conclusion:
    the summary path is useful for semantic labeling and semantic-vs-surface
    comparison, but it is not yet a raw storage win over the upstream summary
    artifact itself
- [x] Find the next richer Dashi-linked artifact that can plausibly beat the raw
  source on storage, not just the normalized analysis form:
  - likely candidates are richer DA51 shard/trace surfaces rather than the
    already-compact `summary.json`
  - use the current `summary.json` run as the semantic calibration pass, not as
    the final compression target
  - resolved target:
    the aggregate `../dashi_agda/da51_shards/*.cbor` corpus
- [x] Compact the aggregate DA51 CBOR shard set with exact shard-byte
  reconstruction:
  - target `../dashi_agda/da51_shards/*.cbor` as a single aggregate corpus
  - compare against the actual raw shard bytes, not only against JSON
    normalizations
  - factor repeated FRACTRAN program skeletons (`ssp_primes`,
    `denominators`, `fractions`, `steps`, `earns_moonshine`) plus semantic
    module families across shards
  - require exact decode back to the original per-file CBOR shard bytes before
    treating the aggregate codec as valid
  - use the result to decide whether the next Dashi-native win comes from
    aggregate CBOR factorization or from deeper trace payloads beneath the
    current shard level
  - implemented in `scripts/compact_dashi_da51_shards.py`
  - regression-covered by `scripts/test_compact_dashi_da51_shards.py`
  - first measured comparison artifact:
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-dashi-da51-shards-compare.stats.json`
  - current result on `../dashi_agda/da51_shards/*.cbor`:
    - raw shard set: `15658` bytes across `41` files
    - compact surface aggregate: `9275` bytes with `33` program motifs
    - semantic aggregate: `9971` bytes with `33` program motifs and `22`
      semantic motifs
  - conclusion:
    aggregate CBOR factorization is the first Dashi-linked storage win that
    beats the raw upstream artifact itself while still decoding exactly back to
    the original shard bytes
- [ ] Decide whether to stop at the aggregate DA51 shard boundary or drill into
  deeper trace payloads:
  - if the current aggregate shard package is the intended publish/export unit,
    the next work should be packaging and upstreaming rather than another codec
  - if the real target is still per-trace structure under the current shard
    payload, inspect deeper trace surfaces rather than building more JSON-side
    analysis layers
- [x] Freeze the below-shard DA51 contract against the shipped shards and
  `PerfHistory.agda`, not `perf_da51.py` alone:
  - document the current positive and negative FRACTRAN payload shapes
  - record that `trace_sha256` currently hashes `counters`, not the FRACTRAN
    trace
  - record which fields are derivable in the current shipped corpus
  - treat `perf_da51.py` as stale or incomplete for this lane until it matches
    the emitted shard surface
  - implemented in `DA51_BELOW_SHARD_CONTRACT.md`
  - added a file-by-file boundary map (40 positive + 1 negative) and explicit
    source-side mapping for `perf_da51.py` vs `PerfHistory.agda`
- [ ] Build the first below-shard codec/model over the real inner FRACTRAN
- [x] Build the first below-shard codec/model over the real inner FRACTRAN
  payload:
  - factor counters, program skeleton, trace, and exception case against the
    frozen below-shard contract
  - use the current corpus invariants only where they are explicitly documented
    in `DA51_BELOW_SHARD_CONTRACT.md`
  - require exact decode back to the original shard bytes for the current
    checked-in corpus
  - compare its size against the current aggregate-shard codec before treating
    it as the new preferred boundary
  - implemented in `scripts/compact_dashi_da51_inner.py`
  - regression-covered by `scripts/test_compact_dashi_da51_inner.py`
  - first measured comparison artifact:
    `benchmarks/results/2026-03-27-dashi-da51-inner-compare.stats.json`
  - current result on the current shipped shard corpus:
    - raw shard set: `15658` bytes
    - aggregate shard surface codec: `9275` bytes
    - inner-payload codec: `5387` bytes
  - conclusion:
    for the current corpus, below-shard factorization beats the aggregate shard
    codec materially while still decoding exactly back to the original shard
    bytes
- [ ] Decide whether to upstream the below-shard codec shape or keep it local
  until the generator side is reconciled:
  - current blocker: `perf_da51.py` does not describe the full shipped shard
    contract, so upstreaming a corpus-specific inner codec without clarifying
    generator ownership could create confusion
  - temporary reconciliation now exists via `--fractran-template` on
    `../dashi_agda/perf_da51.py`:
    - when enabled, generated shards copy matching `fractran` payloads from a
      source shard directory.
    - when disabled, legacy schema-only emission is preserved.
  - if upstreamed, present it as operating on the **current emitted corpus**
    while defaulting off to avoid changing existing generator semantics.
    - when upstreaming, document the exact provenance requirement for full-schema
      generation and the open expectation for a default future mode.
- [ ] Validate and harden the `perf_da51.py` template mode before enabling it by
  default:
  - include a dry-run contract check for full-schema parity
  - decide whether to ship `--fractran-template` as optional only or switch it to
    the canonical mode once the upstream contract is agreed
- [ ] Decide whether the `113` total degeneracy has structural support or should be discarded as coincidence.
- [ ] Write and maintain the short result note distinguishing observations from conjectures for the active `physics22` exploratory baseline.
- [ ] Finish the `fractran` submodule repair after the maintained fork exists:
  - push preserved local branch `frackdash-bench` (commit `6ccc7cc`) to the fork
  - switch `.gitmodules` from `pimlu/fractran` to that fork URL
  - update the tracked `fractran` gitlink to the pushed benchmark commit
- [ ] Intake `monster/MonsterLean` references into FRACDASH with proof-completeness filtering:
  - [x] generate a machine-readable inventory for candidate modules (`MonsterWalk*`, `ComplexityLattice`) with `sorry`/`axiom` flags
  - [x] extract only reusable definitions/constants into FRACDASH-side notes
  - [x] reject or quarantine theorem claims that depend on `sorry`/`axiom` until reproduced experimentally in FRACDASH
  - [x] add a first constants-only 10-walk extractor from `BottPeriodicity.lean` and capture a diagnostic artifact
  - [x] freeze and lock canonical 10-walk semantics with strict-mode artifact gate
  - [x] re-derive the same 10-node walk topology from FRACDASH transition data and verify derivation match
  - [x] expand strict lock to required template set support (`physics8|physics9`) and transition-witnessed canonical edge semantics
  - [x] use lock script defaults as a regression gate (`scripts/freeze_monster10walk_canonical.py --strict-lock`)
  - [x] generate file-by-file Lean claim status (closed vs quarantined) for `monster/MonsterLean/*.lean`
  - [x] add prioritized closure queue reporting for `MonsterWalk.lean`, `MonsterWalkPrimes.lean`, `MonsterWalkRings.lean`, and `BottPeriodicity.lean`
  - [x] close prioritized Lean files by replacing `axiom`/`sorry` with narrowed, artifact-backed executable statements
- [ ] Reproduce the rank-4 obstruction diagnostics locally as artifacts:
  - [x] PCA effective-dimension measurement on the basin-prime matrix
  - [x] independent monotone-chain height measurement
- [ ] Run rank-4 discriminator experiments from `RANK4_OBSTRUCTION_NOTE.md`:
  - [x] root-length test (`D4` vs `F4`)
  - [x] reflection-closure test
  - [x] orbit-multiplicity test
  - [x] Clifford reflection test
  - [x] stability-gradient chamber test
- [x] Add a prime-triplet q-map ablation (`{47,59,71}` vs controls) to check whether obstruction diagnostics are specific or generic.

## Phase 4: GPU Reuse Path

- [x] Confirm which `../dashiCORE` modules are stable enough to reference directly for Vulkan dispatch, shader compilation, and GEMV-style kernels.
- [x] Add a thin FRACDASH-local adapter that imports `../dashiCORE` Vulkan helpers by reference.
- [x] Design a thin FRACDASH adapter layer that imports or shells out to `../dashiCORE` GPU infrastructure without copying files.
- [x] Add a smoke script that proves by-reference import and adapter passthrough without copying CORE code.
- [x] Define the first FRACTRAN-specific GPU buffer layout on top of the new bridge.
- [x] Prove the dense FRACTRAN GPU contract against the compiled CPU baseline on `mult_smoke` and `primegame_small`.
- [x] Turn the dense FRACTRAN contract into the first real Vulkan kernel interface.
- [x] Prove one-step GPU parity on `mult_smoke` and `primegame_small`.
- [x] Expand the Vulkan path from single-state stepping to batched state buffers.
- [x] Keep GPU state resident across many FRACTRAN steps; avoid per-step host/device roundtrips.
- [x] Extend the batched Vulkan path from one-step dispatch to multi-step device-resident execution.
- [x] Reduce submit and command-buffer overhead on the now-correct resident multi-step path.
- [x] Benchmark the single-submit resident GPU path against the dense compiled-equivalent CPU contract on larger batches.
- [x] Expand the routing benchmark beyond `primegame_small` and beyond the current `batch_size >= 32`, `steps = 32` regime.
- [x] Promote the current conservative routing rule into a deterministic CPU/GPU routing rule after more middle-region measurements and one additional program beyond `paper_smoke`.
- [x] Define the rule for when a FRACDASH GPU helper/kernel should be upstreamed back into `../dashiCORE`.

## Open Decisions

- [ ] Which DASHI operations count as the canonical subset for reimplementation?
- [ ] Which signed encoding is simplest while remaining faithful?
- [ ] Should experiments start from a hand-written FRACTRAN kernel, a higher-level compiler, or a wrapper around an existing fast CPU evaluator?
- [ ] What measured hotspot, if any, would justify GPU work later?
- [ ] After compiled-path tuning, is the next CPU experiment a generalized LUT keyed by threshold buckets or a batched/vectorized path?
- [x] Should FRACDASH use direct imports from `../dashiCORE`, local symlinks, or a small compatibility layer for shared GPU assets?
- [x] Should the first Vulkan kernel advance one trajectory exactly or prioritize multi-trajectory batching from the start?
